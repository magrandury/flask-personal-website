# Flask web app

## Installing Flask 

The following works for Python 3 & Windows.

#### Create a project folder and a virtual environment folder within:

```
$ mkdir myproject

$ cd myproject

$ py -3 -m venv venv
```

#### Activate the environment:

```
$ venv\Scripts\activate
```

Your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment.

#### Within the activated environment, use the following command to install Flask:

```
$ pip install Flask
```
